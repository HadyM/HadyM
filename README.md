### Fun fact about me:
 
<strong><em>I love to cook so much that I did it professionally for a long time. My ultimate dream is to travel to every single country of the world to explore their different cultures and technique cooking styles. 
I also like to play video games mostly mmorpg but I am willing to try anything at least once! My passion for gamming led me to that hardware aspect of technology where I learned to fix/build computers and consoles. This led me to coding which I am currently learning at Pursuit. I am open to learning as much as I can and look forward to collaborating on different projects.</em></strong>
