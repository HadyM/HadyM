  <h3>Fun fact about me:</h3>
</div>
 
<strong><em>I love to cook so much that I did it professionally for a long time. My ultimate dream is to travel to every single country of the world to explore their different cultures and technique cooking styles. 
I also like to play video games mostly mmorpg but I am willing to try anything at least once! My passion for gaming led me to that hardware aspect of technology where I learned to fix/build computers and consoles. This led me to becoming a Full Stack Software Engineer and Ruby on Rails contributor! I'm always open to learn a new programming language and love collaborating on different projects. I firmly believe there's no straight line when walking the path of life and as long as you are willing to grow and learn there's nothing you can't accomplish!</em></strong> -->

## 🎉 Fun Fact

> 💡 _"There's no straight line when walking the path of life. As long as you're willing to grow and learn, there's nothing you can't accomplish!"_

I once worked as a **professional chef**, and my love for flavors eventually translated into code! Now, I cook up web applications, fix/build PCs, and contribute to open-source.
