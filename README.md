  <h3>Fun fact about me:</h3>
</div>
 
<strong><em>I love to cook so much that I did it professionally for a long time. My ultimate dream is to travel to every single country of the world to explore their different cultures and technique cooking styles. 
I also like to play video games mostly mmorpg but I am willing to try anything at least once! My passion for gaming led me to that hardware aspect of technology where I learned to fix/build computers and consoles. This led me to becoming a software engineer at Poll Everywhere part of the amazing Integrations Team! I'm open to learning new languages and look forward to collaborating on different projects.</em></strong>
