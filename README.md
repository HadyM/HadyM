## 🎉 Fun Fact

> 💡 _"There's no straight line when walking the path of life. As long as you're willing to grow and learn, there's nothing you can't accomplish!"_

I once worked as a **professional chef**, and my love for flavors eventually translated into code! Now, I cook up web applications, fix/build PCs, and contribute to open-source.
